                            We have a 15-day return policy, which means you have 15 days after receiving your item to request a return.

                            To be eligible for a return, your item must be in the same condition that you received it, unworn or unused, with tags, and in its original packaging. You must record an unboxing/unpacking video to ensure the products arrived in a defective condition.

                            To start a return, you can contact us at pricklybypb@gmail.com, or DM us on Instagram @pricklybypb. You can also request in the My Orders section of the My Account section. Items sent back to us without first requesting a return will not be accepted.
                            <br /><br />You can always contact us for any returns-related query at pricklybypb@gmail.com, or DM us on Instagram @pricklybypb

You must record an unboxing/unpacking video to ensure your product is defective, or damaged or that you received the wrong item.

                            Certain types of items cannot be returned like custom products (such as special orders or personalized items). Please get in touch if you have questions or concerns about your specific item.
